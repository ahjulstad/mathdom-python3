Description: MathDOM - Content MathML in Python
        
        **MathDOM** is a set of Python 2.4 modules (using PyXML_ or lxml_, and
        pyparsing_) that import mathematical terms as a `Content MathML`_
        DOM. It currently parses MathML and literal infix terms into a DOM
        document and writes out MathML and literal infix/prefix/postfix/Python
        terms. The DOM elements are enhanced by domain specific methods that
        make using the DOM a little easier. Implementations based on PyXML and
        lxml/libxml2 are available.
        
        .. _lxml:                  http://codespeak.net/lxml/
        .. _pyparsing:             http://pyparsing.sourceforge.net/
        .. _PyXML:                 http://pyxml.sourceforge.net/

        .. _PyMathML:              http://pymathml.sourceforge.net/
        
        You can call it the shortest way between different term
        representations and a Content MathML DOM. Ever noticed the annoying
        differences between terms in different programming languages? Build
        your application around MathDOM and stop caring about the term
        representation that users prefer or that your machine can execute. If
        you need a different representation, add a converter, but don't change
        the model of your application. Literal terms are connected through an
        intermediate AST step that makes writing converters for
        SQL/Java/Lisp/*your-favourite* easy.
